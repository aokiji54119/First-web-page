                <p>
                    <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan </b>(1936-2021) was a prominent Pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer
                    , known for his pivotal role in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. Often regarded as the father of Pakistan's 
                    nuclear bomb, he was instrumental in developing the country's uranium enrichment capability, which led to the successful nuclear tests in 1998. His work significantly boosted Pakistan's defense capabilities and positioned the country as a nuclear power. However, Khan's legacy is controversial due to allegations of nuclear proliferation, as he was accused of illicitly sharing nuclear technology with countries like Iran, Libya, and North Korea. Despite these controversies, he remains a national hero in Pakistan for his contributions to national security.
